Marble diagram. Illustrate how the debounce works.
![debounce](https://github.com/xgirma/course-learning-rxjs/blob/ch-01/assets/debounce.png)

The debounce method will wait a specific amount of times between events.

_For example_: say you have a search bar, and you want to show the user instant search result as soon
as they type something without waiting for them to hit Submit.

Instead of pinging your server for every letter they type, the debounce can wait for just a few seconds
until we think they are done typing, then ping the server.

Half a second gives almost the same user experience but costs significantly less in traffic to and from the server.
