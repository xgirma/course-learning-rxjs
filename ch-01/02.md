# The Observer Pattern
"A pattern describes a problem which occur over and over again in our environment" Christopher Alexander.

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of 
its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, 
usually by calling one of their methods.

The Observer pattern works well for applications that expect Real Time update. 

So you have an application centered around events or updates. You have a one-to-many pattern with 
one `subject` and many `observers`. When your subject is updated it will fire a method, which will automatically 
call `notify` all observers of a state change, usually carrying some update with it.
